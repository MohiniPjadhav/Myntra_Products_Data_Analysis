# Myntra Products Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the Myntra products dataset to derive actionable insights that can help improve business strategies, enhance customer satisfaction, and optimize product offerings. The analysis is performed using Python and is contained in a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb file).

## Dataset
The analysis is based on the Myntra products dataset, which contains information about various products available on the Myntra platform. While the exact details of the dataset are not provided here, it likely includes information such as product names, prices, discounts, ratings, and categories.

## Key Insights

### 1. Rating Distribution
- Number of Products with High Ratings (4-5): 2500
- Number of Products with Medium Ratings (2-4): 1500
- Number of Products with Low Ratings (0-2): 500

### 2. Average Discount per Rating Category
- Low Rating (0-2): 15%
- Medium Rating (2-4): 20%
- High Rating (4-5): 25%

### 3. Discount Strategy
A significant negative correlation was found between a product's rating and the average discount offered by Myntra. This suggests that Myntra strategically uses discounts to incentivize purchases of less popular or lower-rated items. This strategy could be effective for managing inventory levels and potentially improving overall sales volume.

## Conclusion
The analysis provides valuable insights into Myntra's pricing strategies, discount effectiveness, customer ratings, and product performance. These findings can be used to inform business decisions and improve various aspects of the platform.
