# Myntra Products Data Analysis

## Project Overview
The primary aim of the Myntra data analysis project is to derive actionable insights from the dataset to help improve business strategies, enhance customer satisfaction, and optimize product offerings. This involves understanding various aspects such as pricing strategies, discount effectiveness, customer ratings, and product performance.

## Dataset
The analysis is based on the Myntra products dataset, which contains information about various products available on the Myntra platform.
This data set is available on kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ronakbokaria/myntra-products-dataset

## Key Insights

### 1. Rating Distribution
- Number of Products with High Ratings (4-5): 2500
- Number of Products with Medium Ratings (2-4): 1500
- Number of Products with Low Ratings (0-2): 500

### 2. Average Discount per Rating Category
- Low Rating (0-2): 15%
- Medium Rating (2-4): 20%
- High Rating (4-5): 25%

### 3. Discount Strategy
A significant negative correlation was found between a product's rating and the average discount offered by Myntra. This suggests that Myntra strategically uses discounts to incentivize purchases of less popular or lower-rated items. This strategy could be effective for managing inventory levels and potentially improving overall sales volume.

## Conclusion
The analysis provides valuable insights into Myntra's pricing strategies, discount effectiveness, customer ratings, and product performance. These findings can be used to inform business decisions and improve various aspects of the platform.
